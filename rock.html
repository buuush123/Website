    <div id="intro">
      Even though rock climbing looks scary it still can be easy. All you really need to do is climb a wall, think of it
      as spiderman climbing but instead of watching some terrible actor climb YOU can climb. Rent a harness, climbimbing 
      shoes and a wall, you're practically done already, from there you just climb. When you reach the top don’t stay up long or you will get scared. Then let go of the wall and hold onto that rope  in front of you and fall about 15 feet.Even if you are scared  the belayer has you, in other words you just won’t free fall. Rock climbing is a terrifying sport but you can find joy real fast in it.
