    <div id="intro">
      My story of rock climbing is not really long. Its more of a really small paragraph. I first went to
       a small YMCA camp that was based around rock climbing at planet granite sunnyvale. I wasn't committed
       to it for a while. I originall was alright at climbing doing a few 5.8 and 5.9 but that was for only a
       week. After ,3 years i got back into rock climbing at the age of 13. I climbed till now. I wanted to
       get my belay license but you can’t get it until your are 14 and now that i’m older i have my own, so
       i am free to climb whenever i would like to with a friend.
