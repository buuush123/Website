Now i know that most people that new climbers dont always know what bouldering is.There are many differences between wall climbing and bouldering.The tall walls require a harness shoes and a partner, but boulding does not require a partner. The quick definition of a boulder is a small wall that is more difficult than regular walls because it requires more endurance and upper arms strength. When i just said upper arm strength that does not really mean muscles, just the ability to hang on the something without falling. Boulder walls are as tall as about 8-10 ft, and can be nerve racking coming down. When you climb you need to have all fours on the wall(your feet,and arms), which confirms you have started the wall. Boulder walls are labeled by V, v1, v2, v3 so on. The first level is v0 which is very easy to accomplish, but when you move up to v1s and v2s then you are gonna be challenged much more than you think. The biggest difference between the walls is just the simple physical body, and the wall size. I know that it can look easy but, its hard. After you reach the top let go and fall back, the ground is soft so dont worry about hurting yourself. I believe that bouldering is the best way to practice so jump on that wall and start climbing.
